# 🧩 Wireframing

## 📌 Introduction

**Wireframing** is a crucial early step in the design process of a website or application. It is the process of creating a simple visual guide that outlines the basic structure and layout of a user interface. Think of it as the **blueprint** for your digital product — it helps define what goes where before diving into detailed design or development.

## 🎯 Importance of Wireframing in Design

Wireframes are important because they:

- 🛠️ **Clarify the structure** of a page or screen before investing time in visual design and coding.
- 🤝 **Enhance communication** among team members, stakeholders, and clients by visualizing abstract ideas.
- 🔍 **Identify usability issues** early by focusing on layout, functionality, and user flow — not colors or images.
- 💡 **Encourage feedback and iteration**, saving time and resources down the line.

Wireframes are typically created in **low fidelity** (simple sketches or gray boxes) or **high fidelity** (more refined layouts with placeholders for real content). Tools like **Figma**, **Balsamiq**, and **Draw.io** are commonly used to create wireframes quickly and collaboratively.
